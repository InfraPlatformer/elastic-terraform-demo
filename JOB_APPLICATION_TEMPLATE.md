## üìã **Interview Preparation**

### **Common DevOps Interview Questions & Answers**

**Q: Tell me about a challenging infrastructure problem you solved.**
A: "I built a multi-environment Elasticsearch infrastructure that needed to support development, staging, and production workloads. The challenge was ensuring security isolation while maintaining cost efficiency. I solved this by implementing environment-specific IAM roles, VPC isolation, and using spot instances for development while reserving capacity for production. This resulted in 40% cost savings while maintaining security compliance."

**Q: How do you ensure high availability in your infrastructure?**
A: "I implement multiple strategies: multi-AZ deployments, auto-scaling groups, health checks, and automated failover. For example, in my EKS cluster, I deployed across 3 availability zones with auto-scaling configured to maintain minimum capacity. I also set up CloudWatch alarms and automated recovery procedures."

**Q: Describe your approach to Infrastructure as Code.**
A: "I use Terraform for all infrastructure provisioning with a modular approach. I separate environments into different state files, use remote state storage in S3, and implement proper tagging and naming conventions. I also use GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment of infrastructure changes."

**Q: How do you handle secrets management?**
A: "I use AWS Secrets Manager and IAM roles for service accounts. For CI/CD, I store secrets in GitHub's encrypted secrets with environment-specific access. I never store secrets in code and rotate them regularly. I also implement least-privilege access principles."
