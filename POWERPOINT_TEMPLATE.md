## 🎨 **Design Tips**

### **Visual Elements:**
- **Use consistent colors** - stick to 2-3 main colors
- **Include relevant icons** - emojis work well for technical content
- **Keep text minimal** - use bullet points, not paragraphs
- **Use high contrast** - ensure readability

### **Font Guidelines:**
- **Title**: 36-44pt, bold
- **Subtitle**: 28-32pt, semi-bold  
- **Body text**: 18-24pt, regular
- **Use sans-serif fonts** - Arial, Calibri, or similar

### **Layout Principles:**
- **One main idea per slide**
- **6x6 rule** - max 6 bullet points, 6 words per point
- **Left-align text** for better readability
- **Use white space** - don't overcrowd slides
