- **Animate the flow** from top to bottom
- **Highlight key components** with color coding

### **Content:**
```
[Insert your architecture diagram here]

GitHub Repository → CI/CD Pipeline → AWS Infrastructure

• Development Branch (Auto-deploy)
• Staging Branch (Auto-deploy)  
• Production Branch (Manual approval)

VPC → EKS Cluster → Elasticsearch → Kibana
```

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Here's our complete architecture. The flow starts with developers pushing code to GitHub, which triggers our automated CI/CD pipeline. This pipeline validates, tests, and deploys to the appropriate environment. All infrastructure runs on AWS with proper networking, security, and monitoring."

## 📋 **SLIDE 5: KEY FEATURES**

### **Visual Design:**
- **3-column layout** with feature categories
- **Icons** for each feature
- **Color coding** by category

### **Content:**
```
🏗️ Infrastructure as Code        🚀 Automated CI/CD

• Terraform: Complete AWS        • GitHub Actions pipeline
  infrastructure definition      • Multi-environment deployment
• Helm Charts: Kubernetes        • Security scanning (Trivy)
  application deployment         • Integration testing
• Version Control: Git-based     • Automated health checks
  configuration management

🔒 Enterprise Security

• X-Pack Security: Authentication
• SSL/TLS: Encryption everywhere
• RBAC: Role-based access control
• IAM Integration: AWS security
```

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Our solution stands out in three key areas. First, everything is defined as code using Terraform and Helm. Second, we have a fully automated CI/CD pipeline that handles security, testing, and deployment. Third, we've implemented enterprise-grade security that meets compliance requirements."

## 📋 **SLIDE 6: CI/CD PIPELINE DEEP DIVE**

### **Visual Design:**
- **Flow diagram** showing pipeline stages
- **Color coding** for different stages
- **Success/failure indicators**

### **Content:**
```
CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. 🔍 Security Scan (Trivy)
   ↓
2. ✅ Code Quality (Terraform fmt/validate)
   ↓
3. 🛡️ Security Validation (TFSec + Checkov)
   ↓
4. 🚢 Helm Validation (Lint + kubeval)
   ↓
5. 🚀 Environment Deployment
   ↓
6. 🧪 Integration Testing
   ↓
7. 📊 Notifications & Reporting
```

### **Speaker Notes:**
"Our CI/CD pipeline is comprehensive and secure. It starts with vulnerability scanning, then validates all our infrastructure code, runs security checks, validates Helm charts, deploys to the target environment, runs integration tests, and provides detailed reporting. This ensures quality and security at every step."

## 📋 **SLIDE 7: MULTI-ENVIRONMENT SUPPORT**

### **Visual Design:**
- **Table format** with environment comparison
- **Color coding** for each environment
- **Resource specifications** clearly shown

### **Content:**
```
Environment Comparison

| Environment | Purpose | Resources | Auto-Deploy | Security |
|-------------|---------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Development | Testing | 2 t3.medium | ✅ Yes | Basic |
| Staging | Pre-prod | 3 t3.large | ✅ Yes | Prod-like |
| Production | Live | 5+ m5.large+ | ❌ Manual | Enterprise |

Cost Breakdown:
• Development: $50-100/month
• Staging: $150-300/month  
• Production: $300-800/month
```

### **Speaker Notes:**
"We support three distinct environments, each optimized for its purpose. Development is lightweight and auto-deploys for rapid iteration. Staging mirrors production for testing. Production requires manual approval for safety. This approach gives us speed where we need it and safety where it matters."

- **Before/after comparison**

### **Content:**
```
Cost Management Strategies

💰 Resource Optimization
• Auto-scaling based on demand
• Right-sized instances per environment
• Storage optimization with EBS

📊 Cost Breakdown (Monthly)
• Development: $50-100 (minimal)
• Staging: $150-300 (medium)
• Production: $300-800 (high availability)

🎯 Optimization Results
• 40% infrastructure cost savings
