# 🛡️ **GitHub Rulesets Security Implementation Guide**

## 📋 **Overview**

This guide explains how GitHub rulesets will enhance the security of your `elastic-terraform-demo` repository and prevent the security failures you were experiencing in GitHub Actions.

Based on the [GitHub rulesets documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets), we've implemented three comprehensive rulesets to protect your repository.

---

## 🔒 **Security Issues Addressed**

### **1. Prevented Security Failures:**
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Blocks commits containing sensitive files
- **Unauthorized Changes**: Requires reviews for critical branches
- **Malicious Code**: Prevents pushes of suspicious file types
- **Large File Attacks**: Blocks oversized files that could cause CI/CD failures

### **2. Enhanced Branch Protection:**
- **Main Branch**: Requires 2 reviews, signed commits, and status checks
- **Development Branch**: Requires 1 review and basic status checks
- **All Branches**: Protected against sensitive file uploads

## 📁 **Ruleset Files Created**

### **1. Main Branch Protection** (`.github/rulesets/main-branch-protection.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "Main Branch Protection",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["main"]
    }
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "required_signatures"
    },
    {
      "type": "required_reviews",
      "parameters": {
        "required_approving_review_count": 2
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Unauthorized direct pushes to main
- Unsigned commits
- Unreviewed code changes
- Failed CI/CD status checks

### **2. Development Branch Protection** (`.github/rulesets/develop-branch-protection.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "Development Branch Protection",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["develop"]
    }
  },
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "required_reviews",
      "parameters": {
        "required_approving_review_count": 1
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Unreviewed development changes
- Broken CI/CD pipelines
- Inconsistent code quality

### **3. Security Push Protection** (`.github/rulesets/security-push-protection.json`)
```json
{
  "name": "Security Push Protection",
  "target": "push",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "rules": [
    {
      "type": "file_path_restriction",
      "parameters": {
        "file_paths": [
          "**/*.key",
          "**/*.pem",
          "**/.env*",
          "**/secrets/**",
          "**/terraform.tfvars"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Protects Against:**
- Secret file uploads
- Credential exposure
- Sensitive configuration files
- Large file attacks

## 🚀 **Implementation Steps**

### **Step 1: Apply Rulesets**
```powershell
# Run the PowerShell script to apply all rulesets
.\apply-rulesets.ps1
```

### **Step 2: Verify Rulesets**
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/InfraPlatformer/elastic-terraform-demo/settings/rules`
2. Check that all three rulesets are active
3. Verify the target branches and rules are correct

### **Step 3: Test Security**
```bash
# Test that sensitive files are blocked
echo "test secret" > test.key
git add test.key
git commit -m "Test security ruleset"
git push origin develop
# This should be blocked by the ruleset
```

## 🎯 **Benefits for Your Repository**

### **1. Prevents GitHub Actions Security Failures:**
- **No more hardcoded secrets** in commits
- **Consistent code quality** through required reviews
- **Protected CI/CD pipeline** from malicious changes
- **Automated security scanning** integration

### **2. Enhanced Development Workflow:**
- **Clear review process** for all changes
- **Automated status checks** before merging
- **Protected sensitive files** from accidental commits
- **Better collaboration** through enforced standards

### **3. Compliance and Auditing:**
- **Audit trail** of all rule violations
- **Transparent security policies** visible to all contributors
- **Automated enforcement** reduces human error
- **GitHub Security tab** integration

## 🔧 **Customization Options**

### **Adjust Review Requirements:**
```json
{
  "type": "required_reviews",
  "parameters": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1,  // Change this number
    "require_code_owner_review": true      // Enable/disable
  }
}
```

### **Add More File Restrictions:**
```json
{
  "type": "file_path_restriction",
  "parameters": {
    "file_paths": [
      "**/*.key",
      "**/*.pem",
      "**/your-custom-pattern/**"  // Add your patterns
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Modify Bypass Permissions:**
```json
{
  "bypass_actors": [
    {
      "actor_id": 1,
      "actor_type": "OrganizationAdmin"
    },
    {
      "actor_id": 123456,
      "actor_type": "User"  // Add specific users
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## 📊 **Monitoring and Maintenance**

### **1. Check Ruleset Status:**
```bash
# List all active rulesets
gh api repos/InfraPlatformer/elastic-terraform-demo/rulesets

# Check specific ruleset
gh api repos/InfraPlatformer/elastic-terraform-demo/rulesets/{ruleset_id}
```

### **2. Monitor Security Events:**
- **Repository Security Tab**: View blocked pushes and violations
- **Audit Logs**: Track all ruleset enforcement events
- **GitHub Actions**: Monitor CI/CD pipeline health

### **3. Regular Updates:**
- **Review rulesets monthly** for effectiveness
- **Update file patterns** as your project evolves
- **Adjust review requirements** based on team size
- **Monitor bypass permissions** for security

---

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **"Ruleset not applying"**
   - Check enforcement status is "active"
   - Verify target branch patterns match your branches
   - Ensure you have admin permissions

2. **"Too restrictive"**
   - Adjust bypass permissions for specific users
   - Modify file path patterns to be less strict
   - Reduce review requirements if needed

3. **"CI/CD failing"**
   - Check that required status checks match your workflow names
   - Verify branch protection rules don't conflict
   - Review ruleset conditions and parameters

### **Emergency Bypass:**
```bash
# Temporarily disable a ruleset
gh api repos/InfraPlatformer/elastic-terraform-demo/rulesets/{ruleset_id} \
  --method PATCH \
  --field enforcement=disabled
```
